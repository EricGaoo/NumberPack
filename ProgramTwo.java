// Program name: ProgamTwo
// Author: Eric Gao
// Date: November 22, 2021
// Programming Language: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
// Version: Neon.1a Release (4.6.1)
// Build id: 20161007-1200
//=================================================================
//Problem Definition â€“ required to prompt the user for binary and then to convert to decimal in one line
//I - input of user name, user's number and exit condition
//O - the binary value of their number
//P - The number is run through a similar algorithm to ProgramOne. Each digit is found however this time, it's from right to left. To do this we use a loop where we modulus the user's number for the remainder.
//	  Then, we divide the user's number by 10 to find the next digit. At the same time, each time the loop runs, the exponent that 2 is raised by is increased by 2. Finally, an if statement is added
//	  if the program detects a 1. If it does, it adds the 2 to the exponent to a total. After the loop finishes running, we end up with the decimal value!
//
// 	  101%10 = 1 --> 0(total) + 2^0 = 1
// 	  101/10 = 10
//	  10%10 = 0 --> does not equal 1!
// 	  10/10 = 1
//	  1%10 = 1 --> 1(total) + 2^2 = 5
// 	  1/10 = 0
//

/*List of Variables 
	-let name represent the name of the user - String name;
	-let origNum represent the original number inputed by the user. This will be used in calculation message when the value is calculated - int origNum;
	-let userNum represent the number inputed by the user. This will be updated and changed as the calculations are performed on it - int userNum = 0;
	-let total represent the the decimal value that is calculated from the binary number - int total = 0;
	-let loopCount represent the counter in the for loop to track how many times a number is divided by 10 and modified with modulus - int loopCount = 0;
	-let exponent represent the value calculated when it is raised to the exponent of 2. This number is to the next power every time it runs through the loop - int exponent = 1;
	-let TEN represent a constant for 10 which is used in modulus and division - final int TEN = 10;
	-let isBinary represent whether the user input is binary - boolean isBinary = true;
