//=================================================================
// Program name: ProrgamOne
// Author: Eric Gao
// Date: November 22, 2021
// Programming Language: Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
// Version: Neon.1a Release (4.6.1)
// Build id: 20161007-1200
//=================================================================
//Problem Definition â€“ required to prompt the user for a non-negative integer and then display each digit in the number on separate lines
//I - input of user name, user's number and exit condition
//O - outputs each digit of the number IN ORDER
//P - calculate the number of digits in the number, then use the following calculation method: divide the number by 10 to the power of # of digits-1 and modulus it by 10 [digit = (n/10^# of digits-1)%10]. 
//	  The amount of digits will used in a counted loop and will be used to calculate the digits from left to right which will result in the output being in order. Example:
//
// 	  (192/100)%10 = 1
// 	  (192/10)%10 = 9
// 	  (192/1)%10 = 2
//

/*List of Variables 
	-let name represent the name of the user - String name;
	-let origNum represent the original number inputed by the user. This will be used to store and use the orignal number - int origNum = 0;
	-let number represent the number inputed by the user. This will be updated and changed as the calculations are performed on it - int number = 0;
	-let count represent the counter to keep the nested loop when calculating the exponent of the 10 - int count = 0;
	-let loopCount represent the counter in the for loop to track how many times a number is divided by 10 and modified with modulus - int loopCount = 0;
	-let tenExponent represent the 10 exponent value that the user's number is divided by. This number is to the next power every time it runs through the loop - int tenExponent;
	-let TEN represent a constant for 10 which is used in modulus and exponents - final int TEN = 10;
